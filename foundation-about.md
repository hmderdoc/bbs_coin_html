# BBS Coin Foundation — About

## Purpose
The BBS Coin Foundation exists to steward the BBS Coin ecosystem. It does **not** own the token, individual BBS communities, or user rewards. Its role is coordination, safety, and long‑term continuity.

Authority is exercised collectively through a multi‑signature wallet (Safe), not by individuals.

## What the Foundation Is
- A **steward**, not an owner
- A **gatekeeper for infrastructure**, not culture
- A **coordination layer** between sysops and on‑chain contracts

## Authority Model
- Foundation authority is defined entirely by a **Safe multisig**
- The Safe owns the Treasury contract
- The Treasury:
  - Mints new tokens
  - Deploys and funds Distributor contracts
  - Registers distributors in the Registry

All actions are on‑chain and publicly auditable.

## Membership
Foundation members are Safe signers.

### Joining
- Existing signers approve adding a new signer
- Threshold may be adjusted if needed

### Leaving
- Voluntary removal by signer request
- Removal executed by multisig approval

### Expectations
- Review and approve transactions in a timely manner
- Act in the interest of the broader BBS ecosystem

## Failure & Succession
### Inactivity
- Multisig threshold ensures continuity even if a signer is inactive
- Long‑term inactivity may justify removal by consensus

### Key Loss / Death
- No single key can block the system
- Inactive or compromised keys can be rotated out via multisig

## Changing the Rules
- Thresholds and signer sets can be modified via Safe transactions
- No contract redeploys required

## Limits of Power
The Foundation:
- Cannot alter past distributions
- Cannot confiscate user tokens
- Cannot override sysop reward logic

## Future Evolution
Possible future paths include:
- Expanding signer set
- Introducing community representation
- Transitioning to DAO‑style governance

None of these are binding or scheduled.
